    <h1>Introducing...</h1>

    <p>
      Hello! My name is Chantrice, but I prefer to go by Ace. I am 28 years old,
      a single mom, and I have dreams of being an artist. I love creating new
      things, seeing my ideas come to life, and open up dialogue about things
      that I feel should be talked about more within the community. I enjoy
      photography, dance, graphic design, photomanipulations, as well as
      creating sets or props for physical shoots or film. I am currently working
      on getting into the film industry as a scenic painter and becoming
      unionized within that craft before potentially moving to costumes. Aside
      from that goal, I also want to become a licensed Art Therapist for
      children under the age of 12. My last creative side quest is to be the go
      to creative director for brand building. From logos, to websites and
      applications, to merch, product photography, etc. I have my interests in a
      lot of different pots, but I am confident in my ability to make it all
      happen even better than the way I imagine it in my head.
